Hey folks,

Just a quick note to say I’ve decided to close the forum for **Olde Swords Reign**. The spam was getting out of hand, and to be honest, I just don’t have the time to stay on top of it right now.

Also, I’m not currently working on another edition of the game. Life’s a bit full at the minute, and I’d rather press pause than put out something half-baked. If that changes down the line, I’ll definitely let you know.

Really appreciate everyone who’s been part of the OSwR community so far — it’s meant a lot. Feel free to keep playing, sharing ideas, or chatting about the game [on the discord](https://discord.gg/tUTnXvmn9D). I’ll still be knocking around on the blog and YouTube when I can.

Thanks again for the support!
