## What Is Fourtower Bridge?

A free mini-setting by Nicholas Wiad. It's a starting town that gives you everything you need without drowning you in detail. Pair it with Tomb of the Serpent King and you've got practically zero-prep starter content.

## The Concept

There's a bridge in town with four towers. Each tower belongs to a retired adventurer: a fighter, a wizard, a cleric, and a magic-user. If your game uses training, you've got trainers. If you need quest-givers, you've got them. Old adventurers with connections and missions to hand out.

## What's In It

One page of background. An inn. Stables. A store. A fisherman's shack. A smithy. Everything you need, nothing you don't.

There's a ruined tower where a cleric helps people heal faster. He might want help retrieving a relic. That's your adventure hook right there.

The picture and starting info is almost enough to run with. But it does more.

## The Tavern Table

A table of things that happen at night in the tavern. The tavern is going to be the centre of player activity, and now you've got random events that spawn stories and hooks without preparation.

## The Store Inventory

Millie runs the general store. There's a d20 table of things she's "just got in."

Roll at the table when players walk in. "I've just got this thing in..." Your players will be gagging to find out what she's got. Some of it's cool - affordable Elven footwear. Some of it's mundane. All of it makes the world feel lived in.

## The Point

It's a town that's cool, fun, has everything you need, and costs nothing. Zero prep required.

Nicholas has loads of amazing maps on his blog. If you use this, buy him a beer. The work you don't have to put in is worth it.

## Bottom Line

Get Fourtower Bridge. Pair it with Tomb of the Serpent King. You now have a complete starter setup where you've done practically no work and your players have a home.
