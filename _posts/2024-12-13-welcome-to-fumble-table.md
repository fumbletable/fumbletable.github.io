Fumble Table has a new home.

After years on WordPress, I've moved to something simpler: plain text files, version controlled, hosted for free. No more fighting with plugins, updates, or bloated editors.

The old content will migrate over time. For now, this is a fresh start.

## What You'll Find Here

- **Game Design Thoughts** - Ideas I'm testing, things I've learned running games
- **Reviews** - Systems I've played, adventures I've run
- **Olde Swords Reign Updates** - Progress on my fantasy RPG
- **Interviews** - Conversations with designers I admire

## Olde Swords Reign

If you're here for OSWR, the full game lives at [fumbletable.github.io/osreign](https://fumbletable.github.io/osreign/). That's where you'll find the rules, character options, and referee tools.

This blog is for everything else: the thinking behind the design, play reports, and the broader world of tabletop RPGs.
