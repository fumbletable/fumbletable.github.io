Welcome back, RPG fans! Today, we're taking a closer look at "Old Sword's Reign," a fascinating RPG rulebook that modifies the familiar 5E system into a faster, deadlier, and more old-school experience. If you've ever felt that modern RPGs should be more focused on strategic gameplay over character sheet optimizations, this might be the guide for you. Let's walk through what makes "Old Sword's Reign" stand out and why it could be a worthwhile addition to your RPG library.

### Streamlining for Speed and Strategy

"Old Sword's Reign" is built on the backbone of the 5E system but strips away many of the modern complexities that can slow down gameplay. Here’s how it simplifies the system:

- **Subclasses Removed**: The game does away with subclasses, aiming to simplify character creation and progression.

- **Level Cap at 12**: This adjustment ensures the game remains grounded, focusing on adventure and exploration rather than superhero-like powers.

- **Skills and Feats Overhaul**: Traditional skills are replaced by background-related proficiencies, emphasizing a character's history and experiences over their stats. Feats are optional but integrated in a way that they can enhance the game without overpowering it.

### Character Creation with a Twist

Character creation in "Old Sword's Reign" hearkens back to the roots of RPGs:

- **Stat Rolling**: It reintroduces 3D6 stat rolling, encouraging players to embrace the luck of the dice, which aligns with the game's old-school ethos.

- **Simplified Classes and Races**: With only four basic classes and races, players can quickly create characters and dive into the action. Additional options are promised in future expansions.

### Gameplay Mechanics: Fast and Lethal

The game's mechanics are designed to speed up play and increase the stakes:

- **Simplified DCs and Movement**: Checks are described in descriptive terms (easy, normal, hard), making gameplay more intuitive. Movement rates are streamlined into three simple categories, reducing the need for frequent rule-checking.

- **Revamped Monster Stats**: Monsters now have uniform D8 hit dice, simplifying combat and monster creation. This change means that monsters are easier to manage as a player and a GM.

### Emphasizing Player Choices

"Old Sword's Reign" places a significant emphasis on player choice and risk-taking:

- **Training for Levels**: Characters must train to level up, adding a realistic and immersive element to character development. This feature also introduces a cost component to levelling, making it a strategic decision.

- **Encouraging Risk with Hit Points**: The game encourages players to roll for hit points rather than taking the average, fostering a gameplay atmosphere where taking risks can lead to higher rewards.

### Compatibility with 5E

One of the appealing aspects of "Old Sword's Reign" is its compatibility with 5E. Elements from the book can be integrated into standard 5E games, allowing GMs to adopt the best features for their group without a complete conversion. This flexibility makes it an excellent resource for spicing up campaigns.

### Conclusion: Is "Old Sword's Reign" Right for You?

"Old Sword's Reign" is an ideal pick for those who yearn for the days of old-school RPGs but want to maintain compatibility with the widely-used 5E system. It's perfect for players who prefer strategy and creativity over mechanical complexity and for GMs who wish to streamline their games without sacrificing depth.

Whether you're a veteran gamer nostalgic for the simplicity and challenge of early RPGs or a newer player curious about old-school play, "Old Sword's Reign" offers a compelling blend of the past and present.
