I'm Damien, and Fumble Table is a labor of love born from countless hours around the gaming table.

I've been running tabletop RPGs for years - mostly old-school style games where player skill matters more than character builds, and where the dice can kill you if you're not careful. I love the creative freedom that comes with simpler systems.
