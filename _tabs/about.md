I'm Damien, and Fumble Table is a labor of love, born from countless hours around the gaming table.

Here you'll find my thoughts on tabletop RPGs, game design explorations, reviews of systems I've played, and updates on my own game: **Olde Swords Reign**.

## Olde Swords Reign

My fantasy RPG built on classic foundations. Four classes. Infinite archetypes. Real danger.
