**Four classes. Infinite archetypes. Real danger.**

Olde Swords Reign is my fantasy RPG built on classic foundations. It takes the best bits of old-school gaming - deadly combat, player skill over character builds, exploration-driven play - and wraps them in a streamlined system that's easy to run and teach.

## What Makes It Different

- **Classless feel, class structure** - Four base classes (Fighter, Expert, Cleric, Magic-User) but feats let you build any archetype
- **Dangerous combat** - Low hit points, meaningful choices, real consequences
- **Simple rules** - Runs on d20 + modifiers, fits in your head after one session
- **OSR compatible** - Works with classic modules and adventures

## Current Status

The full rules are being revised. I'm taking the time to get it right rather than rush something half-baked.

**Expect the project to go live before Christmas 2025.**

## Play It

The game is free and always will be. When the revised edition is ready, it'll be available as a PDF and on the web.

If you run a game, I'd love to hear about it - drop into the Discord and share your stories.
